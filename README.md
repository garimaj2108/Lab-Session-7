# Lab-Session-7

# Objective

The objective of this lab is to redesign the existing visualization, critique it and support/refute the claim that "The Financial markets do not punish data breaches".


# Visualization Critique

https://public.tableau.com/profile/garima8871#!/vizhome/Book1_20287/Dashboard1?publish=yes

The above visualization does not make a clear or persuasive argument. It uses two datasets which are essentially displaying the same information, which is stock price trend over last twelve months.

The first dataset is from Information is Beautiful while the second dataset is derived Yahoo Finance. 

The visualization is not able to clearly support/refute the claim "The Financial markets do not punish data breaches".

# Roadmap for improvement

The existing visualization can be improved by introducing additional data points like comparing opening and closing stock prices and determining the effect on stocks following the data breach. I have decided to use comparitive data from the year of breach i.e month-to-month comparison of stock prices in that year.

This will allow me to clearly determine stock price trend.

# Visualization Redesign

In this visualization I have compared three large data breaches from companies like Equifax (2017), Anthem(2015) and Verizon(2017).
