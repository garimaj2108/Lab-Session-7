# Lab-Session-7

# Objective

The objective of this lab is to redesign the existing visualization, critique it and support/refute the claim that "The Financial markets do not punish data breaches".


# Visualization Critique

In the above mentioned visualization,  I am representing graphs through two datasets. The first dataset is from Information is Beautiful while the second dataset is derived from data wrangling of details obtained through Yahoo Finance. The fallacy here is that both datasets are representing the same time period, so they can provide data verification of events but no other insights to make a claim whether or not data breaches affect stock price. 

# Roadmap for improvement

The existing visualization can be improved by introducing additional data points, comparison over a 5 year period and trend lines that help support / refute the claim "Financial markets do not punish data breaches".
